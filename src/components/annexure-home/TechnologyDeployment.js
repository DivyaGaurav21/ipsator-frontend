                        because there is no or limited access for traditional equipment like Joseph Cyril
                        Bamford (JCB) excavator, Poclain, etc. and human settlements on both sides of the
                        drain with narrow passages make it impossible to dispose of the collected waste. The
                        Barapullah drain in South Delhi is one such drain that is blocked at various locations
                        with sewage, trash, and debris, resulting in foul odor, vector-borne diseases, unhygienic
                        conditions, and flooding in the monsoons."

                    missions of the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India,
                    collaborated with South Delhi Municipal Corporation (now Municipal Corporation of
                    Delhi) to jointly pilot an indigenous, customized excavator - Drain Master DM-80,
                    designed and developed by M/s Cleantec Infra Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai. The DM-80 unit was
                    selected to address the critical gap area of technologies for cleaning congested urban
                    drains clogged with mixed waste including construction and demolition debris which
                    are very hard to dislodge and remove.It is a self-propelled, transportable, and amphibious machine with multipurposeattachments capable of removing 50-100 m3/day of waste and overcoming the limits of cleaning urban drains (with widths larger than 7 m) making it an importanttechnology for use in urban areas in India."
