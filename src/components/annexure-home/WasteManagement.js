                    solution=": Unscientific disposal of mixed waste in open dumpsites
                generates harmful greenhouse emissions and contaminate soil and groundwater causing
                health and environment hazards to the cityâ€™s population. Presently, the 469 colonies
                across 64 wards in East Delhi generate on an average about 2200 tons per day of fresh
                municipal solid waste which is disposed unscientifically in five open dumpsites.
                Diverting this fresh waste from entering the landfills will be key to achieve the
                objective of zero landfill."
