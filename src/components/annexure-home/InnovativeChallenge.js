                        Pollution of our water bodies is one of the most critical waste challenges facing India. India is placed 120th amongst 122 countries in the water quality index (“World Water Day”, 2020). Approximately 80% of urban India’s sewage enters river bodies untreated or partly treated (“Around 80% of Sewage”, 2013). India’s Central Pollution Control Board identified more than 351 polluted river stretches on 323 rivers across the country (“River Stretches for Restoration”, 2018).

                        The challenge invited solutions companies and entrepreneurs from India and around the world to apply existing technology solutions addressing urban drains, water bodies, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs across rural and urban areas.

                        The W2W mission invited technology applications from startups, corporates, and
                        entrepreneurs from research institutions to address the challenge of safe collection,
                        disposal/ treatment of large volumes of bio-medical waste being generated during the
                        ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The solutions were sought in areas such as standalone waste
                        disposal units which convert the waste to energy with further possibility to install these
                        standalone units in housing complexes, markets, etc. Innovations & solutions which can be
                        deployed immediately, with the prototype to be collection-cum-disposable unit in one, were
                        sought.

                        The Biomedical Waste Treatment Innovation Challenge Panel assessment had followed a
                        multi-staged process through an Expert Committee formed for this project under the
                        guidance of the Office of PSA. We had received an overwhelming response of 460
                        applicants out of which 8 finalists were selected.

                        The Waste to Wealth Mission is currently working with one of the finalists, GD
                        Environmental Pvt. Ltd., for demonstration and piloting support. A 150 kg/h gasifier has
                        been deployed at Decentralized waste management technology park, Jafrabad for
                        gasification of municipal solid waste (including COVID-19 waste) and is being explored
                        for possible conversion to energy.
